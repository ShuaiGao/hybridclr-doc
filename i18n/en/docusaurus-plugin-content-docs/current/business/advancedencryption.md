# Advanced Code Encryption

Advanced code encryption is a derivative of advanced instruction optimization technology. It is safer and more reliable than standard code encryption.

## Principle

Advanced instruction optimization converts IL instructions into register instructions in advance during the optimization process, and performs complex optimization and transformation, and finally outputs the final instructions.
The final instruction and the original IL instruction not only have different instruction sets, but also do not have a one-to-one correspondence. They cannot be directly reversed, which greatly improves code security.
