We provide a variety of high-end commercial versions and flexibly customizable technical services to meet the needs of game projects in various application scenarios.

## Commercial version

:::tip

All commercial versions will support the **Unity 2019-2022 LTS** version for a long time, ensuring that the project has long-term and stable technical support.

:::

There are currently three commercial versions. The specific features are compared as follows:

- [Pro](./pro/intro.md). Optimized performance and memory to provide higher code security
- [**Ultimate**](./ultimate/intro.md). Contains all the functions of the professional version, and also includes our core [DHE technology] (./differentialhybridexecution), which greatly improves performance and almost (**100% without modification**) reaches the same level as native AOT
- [Hot reload version](./reload/intro.md). Contains all the features of the professional version, and also supports unloading and reloading individual assemblies. Currently, **100%** of the assembly's metadata memory can be unloaded.

### Technical support content

### Price Standard

Since hybridclr is easy to use and stable in operation, most companies do not require long-term technical support, so they only provide timing technical support services.
The unused time in a single service can be reserved for next use. In order to save business costs, we do not provide contracts and invoices for timely billing with a total price of less than 2,000. Please understand.

|Service level|Problem resolution scope|Price|
|-|-|-|
|Standard|Provide technical Q&A on basic usage issues, excluding solutions to bugs and unimplemented features|400 RMB/hour|
|Expert|Solve various complex problems in technical support content, including solving bugs and unimplemented features|2000 RMB/hour|
