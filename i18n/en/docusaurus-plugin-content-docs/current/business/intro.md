# Introduce

We provide a variety of high-end commercial versions and flexibly customizable technical services to meet the needs of game projects in various application scenarios.

## Commercial version

:::tip

All commercial versions will support the **Unity 2019-2022 LTS** version for a long time, ensuring that the project has long-term and stable technical support.

:::

There are currently three commercial versions. The specific features are compared as follows:

- [Pro](./pro/intro.md). Optimized performance and memory to provide higher code security
- [**Ultimate**](./ultimate/intro.md). Contains all the functions of the professional version, and also includes our core [DHE technology] (./differentialhybridexecution), which greatly improves performance and almost (**100% without modification**) reaches the same level as native AOT
- [Hot reload version](./reload/intro.md). Contains all the features of the professional version, and also supports unloading and reloading individual assemblies. Currently, **100%** of the assembly's metadata memory can be unloaded.

## Enterprise technical support

You can flexibly choose the technical service items needed by the enterprise. If you subscribe on an annual basis, you will be billed according to the service item, otherwise you will be billed according to the service length.

### Technical support content

- Standard bug response and resolution, including one-on-one remote assistance guidance. Most reproducible bugs will be fixed within 2-7 days or provide avoidance solutions.
- Solve some special platform compatibility issues
- Supports some currently unsupported versions (excluding 2018 and earlier versions)
- Optimization guidance
- other service

### Price Standard

Since hybridclr is easy to use and stable in operation, most companies do not require long-term technical support, so they only provide timing technical support services.
The unused time in a single service can be reserved for next use. In order to save business costs, we do not provide contracts and invoices for timely billing with a total price of less than 2,000. Please understand.

|Service level|Problem resolution scope|Price|
|-|-|-|
|Standard|Provide technical Q&A on basic usage issues, excluding solutions to bugs and unimplemented features|400 RMB/hour|
|Expert|Solve various complex problems in technical support content, including solving bugs and unimplemented features|2000 RMB/hour|
