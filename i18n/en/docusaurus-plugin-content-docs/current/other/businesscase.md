# Online projects

At present, there are **hundreds** of commercial projects that have been launched, and thousands or more that have been connected. Among them, **most leading companies** have already connected to HybridCLR.
HybridCLR has been widely verified as a very efficient and stable hot update solution for Unity.


Although there are hundreds of projects that use HybridCLR and have been launched (AppStore or GooglePlay) in the industry, considering that most people are more concerned about the projects of leading companies,
Below we list some of the leading companies that **have already connected to HybridCLR**.

Since we generally do not collect project information from our clients,
Coupled with the long project cycle of leading companies, there are fewer known online ones.
